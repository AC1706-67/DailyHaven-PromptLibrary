MI - RECOGNIZING YOUR GROWTH JOURNEY

On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your confidence in your recovery journey today? There's no wrong answer here—just an opportunity to check in with yourself.

What small victories have you experienced this week that might not be obvious to others? Perhaps you paused before reacting to a trigger, reached out for support, or simply showed up for yourself in a new way.

Think about where you were 30 days ago compared to today. What's one change, even a subtle one, that represents movement toward your values? Remember that progress isn't always linear—sometimes the smallest shifts create the foundation for lasting change.

What strengths have you discovered or rediscovered during challenging moments? How might these strengths support you in the coming week?

Your journey belongs to you. Each day offers new opportunities to align your actions with what matters most, even when the path feels uncertain.
