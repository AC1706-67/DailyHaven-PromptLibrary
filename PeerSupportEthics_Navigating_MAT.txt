PEER SUPPORT ETHICS - NAVIGATING MEDICATION SUPPORT WITH DIGNITY

Your choice to use medication as part of your recovery journey deserves respect and understanding. Medication-assisted treatment is a valid, evidence-based path.

How have you responded to comments or situations where your recovery choices were questioned? What boundaries might you need to establish to protect your wellbeing?

Consider the difference between privacy and secrecy in your recovery. What information feels important to share with trusted supporters, and what feels right to keep private? Remember that your medical choices are personalâ€”sharing is always optional.

What would help you feel more confident discussing your recovery approach with new peer supporters? Perhaps preparing a few simple responses, connecting with others using similar approaches, or simply reminding yourself that your path is valid.

Your recovery belongs to you. The courage to choose what works best for your healing journey reflects wisdom, not weakness.
