CELEBRATE RECOVERY - FINDING STRENGTH IN SURRENDER

In early recovery, surrender isn't about giving upâ€”it's about opening yourself to grace and support beyond your own strength.

Where in your life have you felt God's presence this week, even in small moments? Perhaps in the kindness of a stranger, a moment of unexpected peace, or the courage to share honestly with your group.

What parts of your recovery journey feel most difficult to entrust to God right now? Remember that bringing these struggles into the light reduces their power.

Consider one area where you've been trying to control outcomes. How might releasing this control create space for healing? This isn't about abandoning responsibility, but recognizing where your efforts might be better directed.

Your worth isn't measured by perfect days or stumbles. Each time you choose to return to your recovery path, you're practicing the courage that defines this journey.
