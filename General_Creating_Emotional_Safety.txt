GENERAL - CREATING EMOTIONAL SAFETY WITHIN

In early recovery, learning to create internal boundaries is as important as external ones. Your emotional wellbeing matters.

When strong emotions arise, what sensations do you notice in your body? Perhaps tension in your shoulders, a racing heart, or a knot in your stomach. Simply noticing without judgment is a powerful first step.

What activities help you feel grounded when emotions feel overwhelming? This might be breathing deeply for two minutes, placing your feet firmly on the floor, or holding something cool in your hands.

Consider creating a simple phrase that reminds you of your strength during difficult moments. What words would you like to hear from a supportive friend?

Remember that emotional waves naturally rise and fall. When you create space between feeling and reacting, you're building recovery skills that serve you in all areas of life.

What small practice could you try today that honors both your emotions and your need for safety?
