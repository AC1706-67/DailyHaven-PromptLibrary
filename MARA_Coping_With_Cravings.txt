MARA - HONORING YOUR JOURNEY THROUGH CRAVINGS

When cravings arise, remember they're normal experiences in early recovery. Your medication support is working alongside your inner strength.

Take a moment to notice where you feel this sensation in your body. Is it in your chest, your stomach, your hands? Just observe without judgment.

What activities have helped you move through difficult moments in the past week? Even small actions countâ€”walking around the block, texting a support person, or simply breathing deeply for two minutes.

Your body is adjusting to a new balance. This isn't a test of willpower but a process of healing. What would you say to a fellow MARA member experiencing what you're feeling right now?

Remember: Medication support is a valid path. Your recovery belongs to you, and using every available tool shows wisdom, not weakness.

What small step could you take in the next hour that honors both your discomfort and your commitment to growth?
